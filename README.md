## Description

_This website was created to convert numbers into roman numerals.
Specs:
1. The program checks whether or not the number is between 1 - 3999
  Example input: 3555
  Example output: true

2. The program checks if the number is divisible by a roman numeral symbol and sees if it's greater than 1.
  Example input: 3242 check if M (1000) is divisible
  Example output: = 3 >= 1 -> true

3. The program pushes the roman numeral symbol into an array after each check and subtracts the symbol amount.
  Example input: 3242
  Example output: push("M") 3242-1000 = 2242

4. The program doesn't input 3 of one symbol in a row.  It replaces it with the appropriate substitute.
  Example input: 1900 -> ... CCCC
  Example output: CCCC -> CD

5. The program joins the numbers into a string and displays.
  Example input: ("M","M","M","L","X","IV")
  Example output: "MMMLXIV"
